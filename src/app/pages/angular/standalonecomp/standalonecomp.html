  <p>Angular Standalone APIs, introduced in Angular 15, represent a significant shift in how Angular applications are structured and developed. They allow for the creation of components, directives, and pipes that can be used independently, without the need to be declared within an NgModule. This aims to reduce boilerplate, improve tree-shaking, and simplify the developer experience.</p>
